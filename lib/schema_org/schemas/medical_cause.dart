/// The causative agent(s) that are responsible for the pathophysiologic
/// process that eventually results in a medical condition, symptom or sign.
/// In this schema, unless otherwise specified this is meant to be the
/// proximate cause of the medical condition, symptom or sign. The proximate
/// cause is defined as the causative agent that most directly results in the
/// medical condition, symptom or sign. For example, the HIV virus could be
/// considered a cause of AIDS. Or in a diagnostic context, if a patient fell
/// and sustained a hip fracture and two days later sustained a pulmonary
/// embolism which eventuated in a cardiac arrest, the cause of the cardiac
/// arrest (the proximate cause) would be the pulmonary embolism and not the
/// fall. Medical causes can include cardiovascular, chemical, dermatologic,
/// endocrine, environmental, gastroenterologic, genetic, hematologic,
/// gynecologic, iatrogenic, infectious, musculoskeletal, neurologic,
/// nutritional, obstetric, oncologic, otolaryngologic, pharmacologic,
/// psychiatric, pulmonary, renal, rheumatologic, toxic, traumatic, or
/// urologic causes; medical conditions can be causes as well.
